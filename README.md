# Civilization VI Timeline

This website lets you view your civilization's timeline that you can download at the end of a game of Sid Meier's Civilization VI.

Once you have downloaded a timeline, you can upload it to the website and it will display your civilization's timeline.

The path to your timeline (if on Windows, I'm not sure what it is for Mac) should be roughly:
`C:\Users\<YOUR-USER-HERE>\Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\GameSummary`
